## About

## Installation

Fast Scroll is available at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-scroll/dkdnncjokeklapahlhbgfnnakjjaogmb).

### Manual installation

For most users, installing through Chrome Web Store is recommended. However, you can follow these steps if you want a manual installation:

   1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
   2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
   3. Click the Load unpacked button and select the directory of the extracted extension you just downloaded.
