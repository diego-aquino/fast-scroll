## About

Fast Scroll is a simple extension to increase your Google Chrome's scrolling speed while holding the `Alt` key.

★ Easy to use

To activate the increased speed, hold the Alt key while scrolling.

★ Customization

You can change your preferred speed any time by clicking the extension icon. Your preferences are saved and synchronized to your Chrome profile.

## Installation

Fast Scroll is available at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-scroll/dkdnncjokeklapahlhbgfnnakjjaogmb).

After installed, you'll be able to use Fast Scroll out of the box! However, make sure to reload any previously active tabs to apply the extension.

### Manual installation

For most users, installing through Chrome Web Store is recommended. However, you can follow these steps if you want a manual installation:

1. Download the latest stable release of Fast Scroll from the [Releases page](https://github.com/diego-aquino/fast-scroll/releases). The name of zipped extension file follows the example `fast-scroll-v0-3-2.zip`.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file. To ensure the extension is loaded properly, the result should be a folder containing a `manifest.json` in its root, among other necessary files and folders.
3. Install the unpacked extension on Google Chrome
   1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
   2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
   3. Click the Load unpacked button and select the directory of the extracted extension you just downloaded.
